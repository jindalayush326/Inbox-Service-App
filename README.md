# Inbox Mail Service

Welcome to the Inbox Mail Service project! This application was initialized with the help of Create React App, providing a solid foundation to get you started quickly.

Getting Started
Available Commands
In the project root, you can execute several commands to run, test, and build your application. Below is a summary of what each command does:

npm start
This command will launch the development server. Once started, navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the application in action.

Auto-Reload: The page will refresh automatically if you make any changes to the code.
Linting Feedback: You'll also see any lint errors displayed directly in the console.
Here's a quick snapshot of the development mode:


npm test
Run this command to start the interactive test runner, which will watch for file changes and re-run tests automatically.

More Info: Detailed guidance on running tests can be found in the Running Tests section of the documentation.
npm run build
This command compiles your app for production, creating optimized bundles in the build directory.

Production Ready: The build process includes minification and filename hashing, ensuring your app is ready to be deployed.
Here's what the production build might look like:


npm run eject
Important: This is a one-way operation. After using eject, you won't be able to undo it.

Running npm run eject gives you full control over the configuration files and dependencies. This action is typically taken if you need to customize the build tool or adjust the configuration files like Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.

Keep in Mind: While youâ€™ll have complete control, you will also manage all future updates manually.
